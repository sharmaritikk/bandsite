                        ALIVE AT BRUSHY MOUNTAIN
Singer-songwriter Mark Collie, with the accompaniment of an elite band of musicians, was spurred to perform at Tennessee’s Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary – one of America’s most notorious penal institutions up until its closing in 2009. The reason: to spread the infectious vibe of hope and redemption.

Features “Someday My Luck Will Change”, “Got A Feelin’ For Ya”, and more! Also appearances by Kelly Willis, Shawn Camp, and Clarence “GateMouth” Brown!

Mark Collie has been exciting country music fans since he burst onto the scene in the 90s with his honky-tonk-meets-rockabilly style. With five major label albums and sixteen songs on the “Hot Country Songs” chart to his name, Collie has also penned songs for Garth Brooks, Tim McGraw, Aaron Tippin, George Jones, and Alabama to name a few, and currently stars as Frankie Gray on the hit TV series Nashville.Drawing inspiration from country icon (and good friend) Johnny Cash, Collie took note of not only Cash’s celebrated 1968-69 live albums recorded at California’s Folsom and San Quentin prisons, but how his 1958 performance affected Inmate #A-45200: the man the world now knows as Merle Haggard. “Without Johnny going to San Quentin,” Collie says, “there might not have been a Merle Haggard. A lot of lives were changed or made better as a result of that music.”Mark Collie & His Reckless Companions provided an unforgettable music event, and Alive At Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary captures it beautifully.
